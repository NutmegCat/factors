# **Factors**
## Objective

- Write a definition of a method leastFactor that has one int parameter, n. If n > 1, the method should return the value of the smallest prime factor of n; otherwise, it should return the value zero.

- Write a program that uses leastFactor to find and print all the prime factors of numbers read as input. For example, given input of 12, the program should note that the prime factors are 2, 2, and 3. The program should be interactive, prompting the user for values and processing them until a value less than one is supplied by the user.

- Has In.java
- Used Java version 1.2 ~~(*is updated though*)~~
